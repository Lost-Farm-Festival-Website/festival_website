                        From hyper-pop parties that pulse with energy to intimate plant meditations and saunagus, the program offers a flow of unexpected contrasts. Experience everything from outdoor nudejazz and nu-metal to hardcore bass performances that tap into the rhythms of our collective hearts. <br><br>
                        This year, we encourage cultural companions to share stories from the margins, celebrating joy as an act of resistance. As we stumble through traditional lamentations at dawn, we seek to deepen human connection through the power of live art. And of course, we invite you to have a lot of fun along the way!
